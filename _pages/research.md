## Dissertation Project

My Ph.D. project is focused on investigating desiccation tolerance mechanisms in a genus of unicellular green algae *Tetradesmus*, which includes aquatic species as well as terrestrial ones, some of which come from deserts. The close relationship between the algae from such different habitats allows me to compare response to drying and re-wetting across aquatic and desert algae, which is harder or not possible in many other groups (such as land plants).

After establishing relationships among the available species of *Tetradesmus* ()I carried out a crude screening of the algal response to drying in various conditions, and discovered that 1) desert algae are capable of recovering after drying, and they do it in just a few minutes! It is very impressive, desert grasses, for example, take hours to days to do the same;
2) aquatic algae don't recover from severe desiccation, but can re-bounce if the stress is mild and slow; this is interesting because it potentially indicates that the last ancestor that the desert and aquatic algae shared (the consensus is that it was aquatic itself) might have had a certain "toolkit", that was enhanced in desert algae, allowing them to adapt to their harsh environment.
