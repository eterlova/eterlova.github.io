Back in 2019 Dr. Lewis and I described a new species _Tetradesmus adustus_, which was isolated from a desert soil crust in Baja in 1998. Even though there are some morphological characters distinguishing _T. adustus_ from it's cogeners, we base our claim of it being a new species on the phylogenetic analysis based on three gene markers (chloroplast genes _tuf_ A and rbcL, and a nuclear marker ITS2).
