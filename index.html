<IMG SRC=”eterlova.github.io/images/me2020.jpg” ALIGN=”right” />I am a last year Ph.D. student in the <a href="eeb.uconn.edu">Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a> at the <a href="uconn.edu">University of Connecticut</a>, (USA) under the supervision of Dr. Louise Lewis.

<p>My research interests are in the evolution of physiological traits, especially in the algae inhabiting unusual and stressful habitats. My Ph.D. is focused on mechanisms and evolution of desiccation tolerance (an ability to survive extremely dry periods) in a genus of green algae <i>Tetradesmus</i>. This genus is interesting because it includes mainly fresh-water aquating species but also five terrestrial ones, four of which are found in deserts as members of desert soil crusts.</p>
